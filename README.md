A repository for a school project, writing a program for a TI-84 Plus calculator to calculate different things about conic sections.
The program gives different calculations and information about a conic section you put in.

First off it gives the type of conic section it is, namely an ellips, parabola or hyperbola. 
Then it can give the steps to perform a coordinate transformation so the equation gets as simple as possible. Which means it becomes x^2+y^2=1 for an ellips, x^2-y^2=1 for a hyperbola and y=x^2 for a parabola.

It can also calculate the polar form of 2 points relative to the conic.
